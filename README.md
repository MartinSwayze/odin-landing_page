# odin-landing_page
This assignment from The Odin Project is about recreating website from image template to practice using flexboxes and styling using CSS. Unfortunately this pages lacks proper responsivity (especialy on mobile phones). Once I will know more about responsivity maybe I will return to this project and fix it.
